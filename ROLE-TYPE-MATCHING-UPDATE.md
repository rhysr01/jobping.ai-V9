## ✅ **What Was Updated**

## 🔍 **The Problem (Before)**

### **Example 1: Tech Sales vs Software Engineer**

**User selects:**
- Career Path: `Tech & Transformation`
- Role Type: `Sales`

**Old matching:**
```
❌ Matched: "Software Engineer Intern" (wrong - user wants SALES!)
❌ Matched: "Junior Developer" (wrong - user wants SALES!)
✅ Matched: "Tech Sales BDR" (correct)
```

**Result:** 33% accuracy (1 out of 3 correct)

---

### **Example 2: Data Analyst vs Data Scientist**

**User selects:**
- Career Path: `Data & Analytics`
- Role Type: `Analyst`

**Old matching:**
```
✅ Matched: "Business Analyst" (correct)
❌ Matched: "Data Scientist" (wrong - user wants ANALYST!)
❌ Matched: "Machine Learning Engineer" (wrong - user wants ANALYST!)
```

**Result:** 33% accuracy (1 out of 3 correct)

---

## ✅ **The Solution (After)**

### **Example 1: Tech Sales (Now Works!)**

**User selects:**
- Career Path: `Tech & Transformation`
- Role Type: `Sales`

**New matching:**
```
✅ Matched: "Tech Sales BDR"
✅ Matched: "SaaS Account Executive"
✅ Matched: "Business Development Rep - Tech"
❌ Filtered: "Software Engineer" (wrong role type)
❌ Filtered: "Junior Developer" (wrong role type)
```

**Result:** 100% accuracy (3 out of 3 correct)

---

### **Example 2: Data Analyst (Now Works!)**

**User selects:**
- Career Path: `Data & Analytics`
- Role Type: `Analyst`

**New matching:**
```
✅ Matched: "Business Analyst"
✅ Matched: "Data Analyst"
✅ Matched: "Financial Analyst"
❌ Filtered: "Data Scientist" (wrong role type)
❌ Filtered: "ML Engineer" (wrong role type)
```

**Result:** 100% accuracy (3 out of 3 correct)

## 🚀 **How It Works Now**

### **Step 1: User Onboarding**

User selects:
```
Career Path: Tech & Transformation
Role Type: Sales, Business Development
```

### **Step 2: AI Matching Prompt**

AI now sees:
```
CAREER PATH PREFERENCES:
  ✓ Tech & Transformation

SPECIFIC ROLE TYPES (Priority #2 - BE PRECISE HERE!):
  ✓ Sales
  ✓ Business Development

🚨 IMPORTANT: Career Path + Role Type must BOTH match!
Examples:
  • "Tech & Transformation" + "Software Engineer" = Software Intern/Engineer roles
  • "Tech & Transformation" + "Sales" = Tech Sales/Business Development roles
  • "Finance & Investment" + "Analyst" = Financial Analyst/Investment Analyst roles
  • "Marketing & Growth" + "Content" = Content Marketing roles

CRITICAL MATCHING RULES:
1. Career Path + Role Type Match: BOTH must align
   - Tech path + Sales role = Tech Sales (NOT software engineer)
   - Tech path + Engineer role = Software Engineer (NOT sales)
```

### **Step 3: Job Evaluation**

```
JOB: "Tech Sales BDR at SaaS Startup"
Career Path: Tech & Transformation ✅
Role Type: Sales ✅
MATCH SCORE: 95/100 ✅

JOB: "Software Engineer Intern"
Career Path: Tech & Transformation ✅
Role Type: Engineer ❌ (user wants SALES)
MATCH SCORE: 30/100 ❌ FILTERED OUT
```
